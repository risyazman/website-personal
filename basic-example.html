Besides that, I was so obsessed with Shawn Mendes and Cristiano Ronaldo. They gave me more inspiration especially Shawn Mendes, his songs are too good to described. Almost everyday i listen to his songs. For Ronaldo, I like him since I was 11 years old. I love when he playing football and I also love his humble attitude.I have many dreams in my life, when I was a little i used to be a doctor.

<p>Like other teenagers, I also stuck myself in social media. This is the list of my social media:-

The most social media that I love is Instagram, it is because I love to snap pictures. I posts many pictures from my collection in my profile so I can save it there. Instagram provides user to post pictures and videos also can share our daily life stories. During MCO, I also learnt about the new hobbies that I can do in my free time from social media.

My friends and I are very discipline in doing assignments. We are divided our time properly which is we will never disturbed other's time.

We are always study and do assignment together. She was really good in discussion and make me easy to understand what she want to tell.</p>
